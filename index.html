    <h4>About us</h4>
    We are a grassroots movement with a passion for making our goal
    of a lunchtime revolution come true.
    In a sentence, we aim to abolish the "Â£3 Tesco Express Meal Deal" culture
    and replace it with a culture of shared home-cooked meals.
    Fear not, for we are not your everyday kombucha-drinking avocado-loving vegans.
    We aim to bring a certain level of class and nuance to lunchtime vegan meals.
    No bamboo cutlery is to be found here: we source our silverware exclusively from Harrods!
    Plant-based is <em>so</em> much better with Sheffield steel.

    <h4>Get involved</h4>
    Applications are now closed for spring entry into Vegain.
    Please check back in the autumn for details on our next application cycle.

    <h2 style="color:red">*NEW* The Lockdown Tavern</h2>
    From all of us here at Vegain Leeds, we hope that you are staying safe and well.
    In these unprecedented times, the vegan lunchtime dining industry
    has been disrupted. 
    As a grassroots movement, we hope to bring back some normality to the lives
    of our dedicated vegainers. Whether you live in a <em>chic</em> caravan in Wakefield, a mansion with stained glass windows in Headingley, or in the Kensington of the North that is Bradford, WE WANT YOU!
    <br/><br/>
    Join us at The Lockdown Tavern, our virtual pub, on Wednesday afternoon at 5PM (BST).
