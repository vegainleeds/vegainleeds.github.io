    <h4>About us</h4>
    We are a grassroots movement with a passion for making our goal
    of a lunchtime revolution come true.
    In a sentence, we aim to abolish the "Â£3 Tesco Express Meal Deal" culture
    and replace it with a culture of shared home-cooked meals.
    Fear not, for we are not your everyday kombucha-drinking avocado-loving vegans.
    We aim to bring a certain level of class and nuance to lunchtime vegan meals.
    No bamboo cutlery is to be found here: we source our silverware exclusively from Harrods!
    Plant-based is <em>so</em> much better with Sheffield steel.

    <h4>Get involved</h4>
    Applications are now closed for spring entry into Vegain.
    Please check back in the autumn for details on our next application cycle.
